1.0

- added basic movement , jumping (must revisit)

- Cat has 12 HP, represented as 3 hearts (identical to zelda, 3 hearts can be divided into 4 quarters per heart)

- If it's HP drops below 0, it dies and loses a life.
Cat starts with 9 lives. If it loses all 9 lives, the game is over.

- added meow, sheathe and jump function

- Meow is a function that will have contextual uses. Meow, hiss, purr, etc.

- Sheathe is a boolean for determining if a cat's claws are in or out. If in the cat may "boop" harmlessly with it's attack. If out, it's claws deal damage and may evoke aggression. 
Claws out will also assist in jumping, climbing and wallsliding.

-- added crouching. if hold down while grounded, cat will crouch. holding crouch and jump with increase jump force. 
crouching for too long will cause the cat to fall asleep (and disable jump for a little bit)
